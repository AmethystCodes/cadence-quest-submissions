# Chapter 1.0 Day 1 Quests

**1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp**

Blockchain is a database that is publicly avaliable and stores information in a digital format. Information is collected      and stored in blocks. Once a block is filled, it's linked to previously filled blocks and forms a chain of data (or          blockchain). Changing data on the blockchain is very difficult and cannot always be changed. 

**2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts**

Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that run when pretermined conditions within the contract are met. Once the predetermined conditions are met and verified, a network of computers will execute the actions of the smart contract. 

**3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.**

A script is used to view transactions that occur on the blockchain. Scripts do not make changes on the blockchain, they're    used only to view data.

A transaction is used to make changes to the blockchain and is a paid function call. Different from using a script,          transactions cost money to execute. Transactions are usually the only way that changes to the data on the blockchain can      be made.
