# Chapter 1.0 Day 2 Quests

**1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**
   
   * Safety and Securtiy
   * Clarity
   * Approachability
   * Developer Experience
   * Resource Oriented Programming

**2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?**

The 5 Pillars can be useful because they address areas of concern for users and developers. Safety and security is a concern for most people on and offline. Making sure that contracts are safe and coded securely adds user confidence and can result in more user growth. Code clarity is a big deal for users and builders and can relate to the safety and security pillar. For non-technical users, being able to read a line of code and understand it can be an obstacle and a deal breaker. By using code that is easy to read, it's easier to educate users and adds a small layer of additional security because now users are able to potentially avoid malicious transactions. Approachability and developer experience are two pillars that go hand in hand. With the ease of use of Cadence and developers being able to easily transition from other programming languages, this adds value to both the developer community and helps grow the Flow blockchain.
